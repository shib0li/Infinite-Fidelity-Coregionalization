% euqation 1D, based on finite element, model order reduction (via POD)

% -There is indeed no physical problem under this equation.
% -Most of the time this equation is used in order to test a numerical schematics.
% -However this equation is well-kown to show shock formation.
% -It is the 1D Navier-Stokes equation without the pressure term and the volume forces.
